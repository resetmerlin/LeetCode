Given a function `fn`, return a new function that is identical to the original function except that it ensures `fn` is called at most once.

- The first time the returned function is called, it should return the same result as `fn`.
- Every subsequent time it is called, it should return `undefined`.

**Example 1:**

```
<strong>Input:</strong> fn = (a,b,c) =&gt; (a + b + c), calls = [[1,2,3],[2,3,6]]
<strong>Output:</strong> [{"calls":1,"value":6}]
<strong>Explanation:</strong>
const onceFn = once(fn);
onceFn(1, 2, 3); // 6
onceFn(2, 3, 6); // undefined, fn was not called
```

**Example 2:**

```
<strong>Input:</strong> fn = (a,b,c) =&gt; (a * b * c), calls = [[5,7,4],[2,3,6],[4,6,8]]
<strong>Output:</strong> [{"calls":1,"value":140}]
<strong>Explanation:</strong>
const onceFn = once(fn);
onceFn(5, 7, 4); // 140
onceFn(2, 3, 6); // undefined, fn was not called
onceFn(4, 6, 8); // undefined, fn was not called
```

**Constraints:**

- `calls` is a valid JSON array
- `1 <= calls.length <= 10`
- `1 <= calls[i].length <= 100`
- `2 <= JSON.stringify(calls).length <= 1000`
