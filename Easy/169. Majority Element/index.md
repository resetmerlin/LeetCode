Given an array `nums` of size `n`, return _the majority element_.

The majority element is the element that appears more than `⌊n / 2⌋` times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

**Example 1:**

```
<strong>Input:</strong> nums = [3,2,3]
<strong>Output:</strong> 3
```

**Example 2:**

```
<strong>Input:</strong> nums = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]
<strong>Output:</strong> 2
```

**Constraints:**

- `n == nums.length`
- `1 <= n <= 5 * 10<sup>4</sup>`
- `-10<sup>9</sup> <= nums[i] <= 10<sup>9</sup>`

**Follow-up:** Could you solve the problem in linear time and in `O(1)` space?
