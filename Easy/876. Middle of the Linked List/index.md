<strong>Input:</strong> head = [1,2,3,4,5]
<strong>Output:</strong> [3,4,5]
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The middle node of the list is node 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
<strong>Input:</strong> head = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
<strong>Output:</strong> [4,5,6]
<strong>Explanation:</strong> Since the list has two middle nodes with values 3 and 4, we return the second one.
```

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[1, 100]`.
- `1 <= Node.val <= 100`
