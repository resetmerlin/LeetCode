Given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, return _an array of their intersection_. Each element in the result must be **unique** and you may return the result in **any order**.

**Example 1:**

```
<strong>Input:</strong> nums1 = [1,2,2,1], nums2 = [2,2]
<strong>Output:</strong> [2]
```

**Example 2:**

```
<strong>Input:</strong> nums1 = [4,9,5], nums2 = [9,4,9,8,4]
<strong>Output:</strong> [9,4]
<strong>Explanation:</strong> [4,9] is also accepted.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums1.length, nums2.length <= 1000`
- `0 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 1000`
