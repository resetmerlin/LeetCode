Given a string `s` which consists of lowercase or uppercase letters, return *the length of the **longest palindrome*** that can be built with those letters.

Letters are **case sensitive**, for example, `"Aa"` is not considered a palindrome here.

**Example 1:**

```
<strong>Input:</strong> s = "abccccdd"
<strong>Output:</strong> 7
<strong>Explanation:</strong> One longest palindrome that can be built is "dccaccd", whose length is 7.
```

**Example 2:**

```
<strong>Input:</strong> s = "a"
<strong>Output:</strong> 1
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The longest palindrome that can be built is "a", whose length is 1.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 2000`
- `s` consists of lowercase **and/or** uppercase English letters only.
